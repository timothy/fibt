# Friend Info and Birthday Tracker (FIBT)

FIBT is a java swing application. The user will enter in people and add their full birthdays. The user can add as many people as he/she wants… 

Once all the people along with their full birthdays are added the user is able to view the current list of people along with their birthdays and calculated ages. 

The user will have the option to export all people and birthdays to an Excel sheet. The sheet contains rows and columns for each attribute of the people data. This includes a column that auto calculates each person’s age.

If the user already has a properly formatted Excel sheet he/she can import. Once this is imported the user can add more people, view current people, or export back into Excel sheet.

This application should help the user store his/her friends’ info. This also let the user easily export the info into a format (i.e. Excel) that is portable and versatile.
